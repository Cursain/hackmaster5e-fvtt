# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Here be dragons. Here be a LOT of dragons. Truth be told, it's dragons all the way down. Seriously I hope you like dragons.

NOTE: This project had been on hiatus for several months due a mixture of RL obligation and simply needing a break. It's not dead by any stretch and is now returning to return to active development.

## Roadmap
Against all odds, this is venturing close to being a functional product. I am beginning to run out of missing essentials, though it's still greatly inadvisable to run a game with this system. The main thing missing now is sheets for NPCs. I'm practically at the mvp stage and I'm hoping for an initial release soon, pending tests.

##### 0.1.x:  Operation: Minimally Viable Product.
Just gets something out the door that you could theoretically play Hackmaster with. It won't be a convenient experience, but it should be doable, and markedly better than going without.

##### 0.2.x: Feature parity with roll20.
The roll20 system offers some features I won't get to in 0.1.x, and this will be where I incorporate all the missing pieces.
