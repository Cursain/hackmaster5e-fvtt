# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. It's barebones for now, but should get the job done. Definitely more to come. Please note this product is still in an early alpha state, and data models are still settling down. Game-breaking bugs, wildly inadequate functionality, bad craziness. Base data templates are still shifting around with no migration code, so data loss is an absolute possibility. Use at your own risk.

## Roadmap

##### 0.1.x: Minimally Viable Product
Baseline functionality. Everything you'd need to technically run a game of Hackmaster on Foundry. This is markedly better than going without a system at all, but lacking bells, whistles, or polish.

##### 0.2.x: Combat, Refactors, and Polish
Better support for the various particulars of combat in Hackmaster. Fighting styles, combat moves, smarter defense rolls, and so on. In the process, a lot of the ugly "this will do for now" code should get reigned in, here. Lastly, a customized appearance and style for chat cards should happen here.

##### 0.3.x: Inventory Overhaul
A proper, nested inventory system with containers, proper weight management, and more. This should pay off vast dividends, as this functionality could be leveraged to improve ranged weapons, spell libraries, and combat.
