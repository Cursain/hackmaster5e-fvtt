# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster 5e (unofficial) for Foundry. This is in no way usable yet. Here be dragons. Here be a LOT of dragons. Truth be told, it's dragons all the way down.

## roadmap
Presently on the 0.1.x arc. At this early stage, I'm keeping expectations low. Getting this out the door and usable is all that matters. Bigger and better things to come, hopefully!
### 0.1.x
Operation: Minimally Viable Product.
The 0.1.x arc is just about getting something out the door that you could theoretically play hackmaster with. It won't be a convenient experience, but it should be doable, and markedly better than going without.

### 0.2.x
Feature parity with roll20.
The roll20 system offers some features I won't get to in 0.1.x, and this will be where I incorporate all the missing pieces.
