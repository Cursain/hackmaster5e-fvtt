# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Here be dragons. Here be a LOT of dragons. Truth be told, it's dragons all the way down. Seriously I hope you like dragons.

## Roadmap
Against all odds, this is venturing close to being a functional product. I am beginning to run out of missing essentials, though it's still greatly inadvisable to run a game with this system. Chunks of the character sheet are still missing, some calculations are wrong or lazy, and the initiative system has some issues to work out.

##### 0.1.x:  Operation: Minimally Viable Product.
Just gets something out the door that you could theoretically play Hackmaster with. It won't be a convenient experience, but it should be doable, and markedly better than going without.

##### 0.2.x: Feature parity with roll20.
The roll20 system offers some features I won't get to in 0.1.x, and this will be where I incorporate all the missing pieces.
